# BMI_Calculator
A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool used to estimate an individual's body fat based on their height and weight. The formula for calculating BMI is as follows:

The BMI provides a general indication of body fatness and is widely used as a screening tool to categorize individuals into different weight status categories. Here's how a BMI calculator generally works:

### Input:

Users input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) into the BMI calculator.
### Calculation:

The calculator uses the BMI formula to compute the BMI value based on the provided weight and height.
Interpretation:

### The resulting BMI value is then interpreted to assess the individual's body fat. BMI categories are typically defined as follows:

Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
### Obesity:
Class I (Moderate): BMI between 30 and 34.9
Class II (Severe): BMI between 35 and 39.9
Class III (Very severe or morbid obesity): BMI of 40 or greater
### Health Risk Assessment:

The BMI categories are associated with different health risks. For example, individuals in the overweight and obesity categories may have an increased risk of developing various health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.
It's important to note that while BMI is a useful screening tool, it has limitations. It does not directly measure body fat percentage, and the distribution of fat in the body is not considered. As a result, individuals with similar BMI values may have different body compositions.
